# User Prompts/Requests Given to AI Assistant

## =============================================================================
## PROJECT SETUP AND REQUIREMENTS
## =============================================================================

### 1. Initial Project Request
"under readme file, create a software requirement document for the project Spotify Agent. goal is: to specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the Spotify Agent system. The purpose of this system is to build a smart assistant that can access a user's Spotify account, analyze listening habits, and generate personalized music recommendations."

### 2. Technology Stack Update
"under READme file, we are using openai api for building recommendation engine."

### 3. Application Type Clarification
"it is not a web based application. its a chat based cli based application. everything will happen on terminal"

### 4. Technology Stack Specification
"we will be using python, tensorflow, pytorch, spotipy and no nodeJS and its dependencies"

## =============================================================================
## ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION
## =============================================================================

### 5. Environment File Creation
"create a .env file and i will add all the api keys needed fro the project"

## =============================================================================
## SPOTIFY CLIENT DEVELOPMENT
## =============================================================================

### 6. Spotify Client Creation
"create a spotify_client.py file, use the created .env file to authenticate with Spotify using OAuth. Print the logged-in user's display name and email to confirm connection. Use the spotipy and python-dotenv libraries."

## =============================================================================
## OPENAI CLIENT DEVELOPMENT
## =============================================================================

### 7. OpenAI Client Creation
"lets integrate openai now. craete openai.py file which 
use the model gpt-3.5-turbo,
loads the api key from env file,
initialize openai client using openai sdk (use openai>=1.0.0),
include a method chat(prompt: str) -> str that sends a user prompt to GPT-3.5 and returns a response,
Add a test main() block where I give a sample prompt like: 'I like Pritam and Arijit Singh, Find me 5 similar ones'.

the expected output should be:
User: Can you suggest 5 songs I might like if I enjoy music by Pritam and Arijit Singh?
GPT: Sure! Here are 5 songs you might like:
1. Tum Mile – Pritam, KK
2. Raabta – Arijit Singh
3. Kabira – Pritam, Tochi Raina
..."

## TROUBLESHOOTING AND DEBUGGING
## =============================================================================

### 8. Virtual Environment Setup
"command to create venv"

### 9. Dependency Installation Issue
"pip install openai>=1.0.0
zsh: 1.0.0 not found"

### 10. File Naming Conflict
"what error this is?" (referring to ImportError with openai.py)

### 11. Scope Error Analysis
"what error this is?" (referring to 403 Insufficient client scope error)

### 12. Syntax Error Fix
"if i have to send multiple mood parameter then it should be in []"

## =============================================================================
## CODE OPTIMIZATION AND CLEANUP
## =============================================================================

### 13. Test Simplification
"for openai_client keep only music recommendation test"

### 14. Function Cleanup
"comment out all the uneccesary function which are not used and keep only the remaining part."

### 15. Structured Test Removal
"why do we need structured recommendation test?"

### 16. Function Commenting
"comment out the structured recommendation test in the openai_client for now."

### 17. Function Documentation
"what are the other functions are added in the openai_client?"

## =============================================================================
## DOCUMENTATION
## =============================================================================

### 19. Prompt Documentation
"can you write all the propmts i gave through the project in prompt.txt"

### 20. Clarification Request
"i meant the prompt input i gave you"

## =============================================================================
## OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS
## =============================================================================

### 21. AI Behavior Analysis
"whats the observation. it reads arijit singh properly but not pritam?"

## =============================================================================
## NOTES
## =============================================================================

### Key Themes in User Requests:
1. **Project Setup**: Requirements, technology stack, application type
2. **Environment Configuration**: API keys, dependencies, virtual environment
3. **Client Development**: Spotify and OpenAI integration
4. **Troubleshooting**: Errors, conflicts, syntax issues
5. **Code Optimization**: Cleanup, simplification, documentation
6. **Analysis**: AI behavior, observations, improvements

### Development Flow:
1. Started with requirements documentation
2. Moved to environment setup
3. Built individual clients (Spotify, OpenAI)
4. Encountered and resolved various issues
5. Optimized and cleaned up code
6. Documented the entire process

### Common Issues Encountered:
1. File naming conflicts (openai.py vs openai library)
2. Shell interpretation of special characters (>=)
3. OAuth scope permissions
4. Syntax errors in function calls
5. Import conflicts and dependencies
